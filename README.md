# FooFa NFT Liquidity Protocol for ERC1155

Tools used :
Covalent Api, Moralis , Scaffold Eth. Polygon etc

You can fractionalize any ERC1155 NFT into on chain tokens that are traded freely.
This protocol also incentivizes the liquidity providers to provide funds to the NFT owner in return of the fractionalized tokens. 



A simple and easy to use Dapp, with smart contract built wholly from scratch, I welcome you all to try the dapp on foofanft.surge.sh

Just mint a ERC1155 NFT on matic chain, and you are good to fractionalize and play around with the minted tokens and maybe get some new idea on how to improve this protocol.
